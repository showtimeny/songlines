WELCOME.

This is the source code for the SONGLINES web app. It will be integrated with the existing blog at 
songlinesmusic.com and serve as a tool for radio adds tracking. The app scrapes data from FMQB.com, 
mediabase.com, and Nielsen DTS, integrates it into a sqlite3 database, and displays it in interesting 
ways. Labels, pluggers, radio stations, and artists will each have an interest in owning an account 
here, because it is by far the most accurate and useful collection of such information on the web.

As of 7/13/2012, the FMQB scraper is complete and this week's data has been pushed to the DB.

TO-DO:  1. Write a historical scraper for FMQB that pulls data for ALL weeks (from 2010-2012)
        2. Write a scraper for Nielsen DTS
        3. Write a scraper for MediaBase
        4. Design a web front-end for all this damn data

HAPPY HACKING.
